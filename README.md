This is a beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating the "Caesar Cipher", a classical encryption technique.  
It allows users to 'encrypt and decrypt messages' by shifting letters by a chosen value. 

## Purpose
This project is my "first hands-on task in cybersecurity", focusing on understanding 'basic encryption techniques' and strengthening foundational skills in cryptography.

## Features
- Encrypt messages using a custom shift value
- Decrypt messages using the same shift value
- Works with uppercase, lowercase, and preserves spaces/special characters
- Interactive version available for Google Colab with sliders and dropdowns

 ## Tech Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab

 ## How to Run
- **Google Colab**: Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells  
- **Local Python**: Run the `.py` file using Python 3
